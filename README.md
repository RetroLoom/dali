DOS IPX driver that connects to a DOSbox server.

This allows real DOS machines to connect to a DOSbox network server using
a packet driver. It reimplements the Novell IPX API that is used by most
DOS games for communicating over a LAN.

This is currently in a very alpha stage of development.

Uses the [mTCP](http://www.brutman.com/mTCP/) stack by Michael Brutman.
